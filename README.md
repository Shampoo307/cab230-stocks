This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This client-side university project is a website made to interact with the uni's API, and display some given stock data
taken from the American stock exchange. Data is intially displayed in a table, with further options on login 
(authentication implemented using JWT), to dispaly stock details from within a user-specified time frame, as well
as a graph of that same data.
